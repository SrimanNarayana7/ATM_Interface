# ATM_Interface

This is a console based application that allows users to perform basic banking operations like withdrawing, depositing, and checking their balance.

# Usage

The ATM Interface Application provides the following options:

Check balance: displays the current balance of the account.<br>
Withdraw cash: allows the user to withdraw a certain amount of cash from the account.<br>
Deposit cash: allows the user to deposit a certain amount of cash into the account.<br>
Transfer cash: allows the user to transfer money from one account to other account.<br>
Exit: exits the ATM simulator.<br>

When the user selects the withdraw or deposit options, they will be prompted to enter the amount of cash they wish to withdraw or deposit. The simulator will validate the input to ensure that the amount is valid (i.e. not negative or greater than the available balance).
